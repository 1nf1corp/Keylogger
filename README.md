# Keylogger
A python keylogger. 

You'll need the pyHook and pythoncom modules for this to work.

Adaptation of https://github.com/ajinabraham/Xenotix-Python-Keylogger simply change the variables:

"SERVER, PORT, USER, PASS, FROM, TO" 

To your specifications and compile the script to exe with pyinstaller for distribution, use the --noconsole flag when compiling.
